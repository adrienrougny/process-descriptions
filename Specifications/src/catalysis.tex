\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Catalysis}}
\label{sec:catalysis}

A catalysis is a particular case of stimulation, where the effector affects positively the flux of a process represented by the target process. The positive effect on the process is due to the lowering of the activation energy of a reaction.
