SBO:0000173 ! and


\glyphIncoming One or more \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{logicArc}).



\glyphOutgoing
One \glyph{logic arc} (\sect{logicArc}) or \glyph{modulation arc} (\sect{modulations}).


\glyphContainer
An \glyph{and} operator is represented by a circular shape containing the word ``AND''.
The shape is linked to two ports, that are small arcs attached to the centres of opposite sides of the shape, as shown in \fig{and}.
The incoming \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{logicArc}) are linked to the extremity of the leftmost or uppermost port, while the outgoing \glyph{logic arc} (\sect{logicArc}) or \glyph{modulation} (\sect{modulation}) is linked to the extremity of the rightmost or bottommost port.
