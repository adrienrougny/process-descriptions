\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Phenotype}}
\label{sec:phenotype}

A biochemical network can generate phenotypes or affect biological processes.
Such processes can take place at different levels and are independent of the biochemical network itself.
To represent these processes in a map, \PD defines the \glyph{phenotype} glyph.

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm
SBO:0000358 ! phenotype

\add{

}

\add{

}

\glyphContainer
A \glyph{phenotype} is represented by an elongated hexagonal shape, as shown in \fig{phenotype}.

\glyphLabel
A \glyph{phenotype} is identified by a label that is \corr{an unbordered box containing}{} a string of characters \corr{.
The characters}{that} may be distributed on several lines to improve readability.
The centre of the label must be placed on the centre of the shape.
The label may extend outside of the shape.
