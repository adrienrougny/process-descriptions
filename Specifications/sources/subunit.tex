\subsection{Glyph\add{s}: \glyph{Subunits}}
\label{sec:subunit}

\corr{The \glyph{subunit} is used to describe the composition of the \glyph{complex}.
A \glyph{complex} can optionally be decorated with one or more subunits, which represent the types of \corr{\glyph{EPN}}{entities} that may aggregate to form a \glyph{complex}.
A \glyph{subunit} is an auxiliary unit that decorates the \glyph{complex} and does not represent or mimic an \glyph{EPN} directly, it only indicates the type of subunit included in the \glyph{complex}.
The example in \fig{complexSubunits} illustrates the use of \glyph{subunits} in a \glyph{complex}.
It also shows an equivalent complex without subunits.
}
{
A complex is formed by the non-covalent binding of two or more entities, that become the subunits of the complex.
In \PD, the composition of a complex may be described using \glyph{subunit} glyphs, that are auxiliary units decorating \glyph{complexes}.
\glyph{Subunits} do not represent or mimic entity pools~(\sect{EPNs}) and may only be used to represent the subunits included in a complex.
The example in \fig{complexSubunits} illustrates the use of \glyph{subunits} to describe the composition of a complex.
It also shows how the same complex can be represented without decorating \glyph{subunits}.
}

\add{
The SBGN \PD defines nine different \glyph{subunit} glyphs, each representing a different type of bio-molecular (sub)-entity.
The five main \glyph{subunits} are the \glyph{unspecified entity subunit}, \glyph{macromolecule subunit}, \glyph{simple chemical subunit}, \glyph{nucleic acid feature subunit}, and \glyph{complex subunit}.
\rougny{Maybe no need to list all subunits?}
This latter \glyph{subunit} allows representing complexes formed of other complexes.
The remaining four \glyph{subunits} are multimeric: \glyph{multimer of macromolecules subunit}, \glyph{multimer of simple chemicals subunit}, \glyph{multimer of nucleic acid feature subunit}, and \glyph{multimer of complexes subunit}.

\add{\glyphAux A \glyph{subunit} may carry auxiliary units, depending on its type.}

\add{A \glyph{macromolecule}, \glyph{nucleic acid feature}, or \glyph{complex subunit} can carry one or more \glyph{state variables} that add information about its state (\sect{stateVariable}).
The state of such a \glyph{subunit} is defined as the set of all its \glyph{state variables}.}

\add{A \glyph{macromolecule}, \glyph{simple chemical}, \glyph{nucleic acid feature}, or \glyph{complex subunit} can carry one or more \glyph{units of information} (\sect{unitInfo}).
These can characterize a domain, such as a binding site.
Particular \glyph{units of information} are available for describing the material type (\sect{material-types-cv}) and conceptual type (\sect{conceptual-types-cv}) of such a \glyph{subunit}}.
