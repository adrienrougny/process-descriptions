\subsection{Glyphs: \glyph{Subunits}}
\label{sec:subunit}


\glyphContainer
Each \glyph{subunit} is represented by its own shape depending on its bio-molecular nature, as shown in \tab{subunit_containers}.
Those shapes are the same as those used to represent entity pools~(\sect{EPNs}).

  \caption{Both these complex glyphs are equivalent.
      The complex on the left is described using \glyph{subunit} decorators.
      The complex on the right depicts the same information, without explicitly representing those subunits, that are only suggested by the label of the \glyph{complex}.
  However, their states are represented using \glyph{state variables} decorating the \glyph{complex}.}
