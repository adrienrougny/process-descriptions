\subsection{\glyph{Submap}}\label{sec:submap}

\corr{A \glyph{submap} is used to encapsulate processes (including all types of nodes and edges) within one glyph.
The \glyph{submap} hides its content to the users, and displays only \corr{input terminals (or ports)}{\glyph{submap terminals} (\sect{submapTerminal})}, linked to \glyph{EPNs} (\sect{EPNs}) \add{or \glyph{compartments} (\sect{compartment})}.
A \glyph{submap} is not equivalent to an \glyph{omitted process} (\sect{omitted}).
\luna{032819 maybe later can we have another section called implementation notes? for this kind of information?}
In the case of an SBGN map that is made available through a software tool, the content of a \glyph{submap} may be available to the tool.
A user could then ask the tool to expand the \glyph{submap}, for instance by clicking on the icon representing the \glyph{submap}.
The tool might then expand and show the \glyph{submap} within the same map (on the same canvas), or it might open it in a different canvas. In the case of an SBGN description made available in a book or a website, the content of the submap may be available on another page, possibly accessible via an hyperlink on the \glyph{submap}.

\rougny{If we make a distinction between the tag glyph and the submap terminal glyph, it is difficult to allow for submap expansion inside of the submap glyph (because submap terminals would also become tags, and that would become complicated).
Since there are also no examples in V1.3 where a submap is expanded inside a submap glyph, maybe it is best to just forbid that.
I rewrote the paragraph and this entire section as if it was forbidden.
Maybe it should be discussed.
UD: This doesn't sound like expanding is forbidden to me. Also, I am not sure if it's a good idea to talk about software/tool issues. I agree that this stuff should be designed to address tool issues but I am not sure if this new version is the right time.

VT: When expanding a submap glyph to show it's content in the main map, wouldn't the submap terminals and tags disappear? That is how I understood this. So it is up to the tool, I would think, to take care of this 'mapping' and 'reasoning'. SBGN provides a way to connect both maps through the terminal and tag, no?

The \glyph{submap} is represented as a square box, to remind that it is fundamentaly a process.

A \glyph{submap} is represented by a rectangular shape, to remind that it is fundamentally a process.

\glyphLabel
\corr{
The identification of the \glyph{submap} is carried by an unbordered box containing a string of characters.
The characters may be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box has to be attached to the center of the container box.

\glyphAux
\corr{A \glyph{submap} carries labeled terminals. When the submap is represented folded, those terminals are linked to external EPNs (section~\ref{sec:EPNs}) or containers (section~\ref{sec:CNs}). In the unfolded view, exposing the internal structure of the submap, a set of \glyph{tags} point to the corresponding internal EPNs (section~\ref{sec:EPNs}) or containers (section~\ref{sec:CNs}).

A \glyph{submap} must carry one or more \glyph{submap terminals} (\sect{submapTerminal}), each linked to an \glyph{EPN} (\sect{EPNs}) or \glyph{compartment} (\sect{compartment}) of the map using an \glyph{equivalence arc} (\sect{equivalenceArc}).

Note that the terminals do not define a ``direction'', such as input or output. The flux of the reactions is determined by the context.
