\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Or}}
\label{sec:or}

\corr{The glyph \glyph{or} is used to denote that any of the \glyph{EPNs} linked as input is sufficient to produce the output.}
{
The output of an \glyph{or} glyph is True if at least one of its inputs is True, and False otherwise.
}

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm
SBO:0000174 ! or

\corr{
\glyphOrigin More than one \glyph{EPN} (section~\ref{sec:EPNs}) or \glyph{logical operator} (section~\ref{sec:logic}).
}{
\glyphIncoming One or more \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{logicArc}).
}

\corr{
\glyphTarget  One modulation (section~\ref{sec:modulation}), stimulation (section~\ref{sec:stimulation}), catalysis (section~\ref{sec:catalysis}), inhibition (section~\ref{sec:inhibition}) or necessary stimulation (section~\ref{sec:necessary_stim}) arc.
}{
\glyphOutgoing
One \glyph{logic arc} (\sect{logicArc}) or \glyph{modulation arc} (\sect{modulations}).
}

\glyphContainer
An \glyph{or} operator is represented by a circular shape containing the word ``OR''.
The shape is linked to two ports, that are small arcs attached to the centres of opposite sides of the shape, as shown in \fig{or}.
The incoming \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{logicArc}) are linked to the extremity of the leftmost or uppermost port, while the outgoing \glyph{logic arc} (\sect{logicArc}) or \glyph{modulation} (\sect{modulation}) is linked to the extremity of the rightmost or bottommost port.

\glyphLabel
\corr{An \glyph{or} operator is not identified by any label}{None}.

\glyphAux
\corr{An \glyph{or} operator does not carry any auxiliary items}{None}.
